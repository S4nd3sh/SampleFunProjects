I'll be posting all of the interesting stuffs that I do on my free time.

Something like creating a simulation to know what number of people who played  
The Russian Roulette constantly for 25 years survived. I read this idea in a book called "Fooled by Randomness" recently. 
By the way, the book is fantastic and I highly recommend anyone who is stating to trade in the markets to give it a try.  

The convergence of a coin toss to 0.5 probability.

That's the basic idea of this repo. 


Thank you for your time.  
Have a pleasant day.
